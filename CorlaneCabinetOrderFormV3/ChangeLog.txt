3.0.1.1 
	Changed ZoomExtents helper to allow a threshold before zooming to extents. Also disabled ResetToFrontView for the Hide buttons. Now cabinet doesn't jump around when hiding/adding/removing parts.

3.0.1.2
	Changed Main Tab Control to go full window width when the Process Order Tab is clicked.

3.0.1.3
	Added "Loading Job" and "Saving Job" status messages to the status bar, so when Windows is a POS and freezes on load or save, at least the user knows something is happening.
	Fixed bug where drawer fronts would not resize properly when clicking Load Defaults.
	Added place order confirmation dialog.

3.0.1.4
	Fixed bug with Filler breaking price and showing "Custom material" price notification.

3.0.1.5
	Added view manipulation help text to viewport
	Added Help button to open website help page

3.0.1.6
	Changed upper Nailers to 4"
	Changed color of Help button image to be more visible in all themes
	Added notification when canceling a load or save dialog
	Changed hinge holes exception tab to ignore Drawer cabinets

3.0.1.7
	Fixed copy-paste error where Drw Box 3 was called Drw Box 2 in the Box Size List

3.0.1.8
	Changed directory structure to accommodate 1/4 and 3/4 directories.
	Forced corner cabinets to Add and Update with 3/4 backs since 1/4 backs are not an option.
	Adjusted some dimension range limits.

3.0.1.9
	Hacky bugfix for drawerfrontheight1 textbox. Had to change update trigger to lostfocus to avoid issues with invalid input preventing updates.
	Prevent entering custom species names when Custom isn't chosen for remainging cabinet types. Base cabinets were already done.

3.0.1.10
	Fixed infinite loop in ConvertDimension when numerator = 0
	Allowed shorter window height and auto scrollbars to accommodate Fisher Price's My First Computer (tm).
	Added export to csv options under Print button for the Lists.

3.0.1.12
	Large refactor. Broke cabinet3dviewmodel into Rendering folder mostly.
	Changed awful color of Custom material.
	Changed POCabspecies, POEdgebanding, and PODoorspecies to show custom material name when Custom is selected.

3.0.1.13
	Added "ordered with" text to POCustomerInfo to show version of app the job was ordered with.

3.0.1.14
	Dragging and dropping a cabinet now triggers the Modified flag.
	Cabinet list now auto-scrolls when dragging and dropping to a position outside of the visible area. Scrolling speed is adjustable. CabinetListView.xaml.cs is where it lives.
	Fixed bug where upper cabinet style dimensions were not showing when changing style from the cabinet list. (added onstylechanged to maptoviewmodel. It surely was there before, but got AI'd out at some point)
	Fixed bug where base Angle Front top and deck were not positioned correctly. (Add Children was adding deck and top, not deckRotated and topRotated)

3.0.1.15
	Added "debouce" routine to DrwFrontHeight1 so it "live-updates", without needing to tab out of the box to update the value. This could cause other problems, but seems to work. Revert back to 3.0.1.14 if it does, since this is the only change, nothing else will be lost.
