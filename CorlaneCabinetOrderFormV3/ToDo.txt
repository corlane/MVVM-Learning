User side:

Finish angle corner cabinet models -- DONE except angle front base toekick board needs to be worked out - I don't think we have a way to do this yet, since we don't normally offer these. 

Finish validation (don't foget to disable add, place order buttons etc. on invalid form) -- DONE. Most validation seems To work as intended. Check more via beta-testing.
	Run Validation on tab change too -- shit doesn't work. The only thing that works is the validation textblocks. So be it. -- DONE. Most validation seems To work as intended. Check more via beta-testing.

Fix "Connected" indicator. It doesn't seem to update properly. Use whatever method was used in CorlaneCabinetOrderFormV2. -- Looks like it is working on bedroom computer. Leave as is and check later.
	It is *NOT* working consistently, even on bedroom computer.

Implement connection for order submission and material price retrieval -- DONE

Hide back thickness selection for corner cabinets -- DONE

When clicking on cabinet list, run dimensions thru converter to display in user's selected units before populating form fields -- DONE

Panel thickness dropdown needs to change based on dimension format. As is, it won't populate properly. -- DONE

If cabinet depth is too shallow for drw, display warning - remove drws and hide drw group box - or, adjust depth range validation based on whether cab has drws

Add nailers on cabs with 1/4" back, base and upper cabs -- DONE

On base cab drw front section, add "Equalize" for bottom drw equalization, and an "Equalize All" button to duh make all drw fronts equal. -- DONE

OPTIONAL: Add thumbnail images in ListCabinetView -- Talked to AI about it. Looks less complex than I thought. Can be done later. See previous AI chat for details.
OPTIONAL: Add visible shelf holes, pockets, drw slide mounting holes, etc. in 3D preview
OPTIONAL: Change image loading in Cabinet3DViewModel to utilize the grain direction setting. This will allow the removal of duplicate material images for horizontal and vertical grain.
	Have already added material images to image folder with Horizontal and Vertical suffixes removed.







Corlane side:

Get material yield correct -- Seems to be correct so far. Need to do more testing. -- DONE

Add tab or window for order processing -- DONE

Save customer information & quoted price in job file -- DONE

Set up clickonce installer -- DONE

Add icon -- DONE

Account for edgebanding on bottom edge of upper end panels -- DIFFICULT, since edgebanding routine does not allow for 2 different edgebanding values on a single panel. -- DONE

NOTE! 45 degree cab shows front width, which is the front width of the deck or top, not the corner-to-corner width. Should we change this? The math will be tricky. -- NOT NECESSARY

1/4" backs need to add 1/4" PFP to material totals -- DONE

Need to warn if cabinet depth is > ~24, so drawer boxes can be resized in eCabs

Change directory name creation in Batch List viewmodel to delve into the proper directories based on cabinet Type and Style -- DONE

Change material to allow for UP and DOWN versions of each raw plywood species. Change individual cabinet parts to be made of the appropriate UP or DOWN material. -- DONE

CNC price needs to be calcuated by sq ft instead of per sheet. -- DONE

On stupidly wide cabinets, an Exception tab to notify us to change grain direction on back

If cabinet is 1 door cabinet and doors are NOT supplied, have batch list load a 2 door cabinet. -- HODL

Add 3 characters to model name for Shelf Depth and Drill Shelf Holes and Trash Drawer. -- DONE

Use Notify for uploading material prices - the small text notification doesn't grab enough attention. -- DONE

Account for Custom material in price calc. -- DONE

Opening size Exception Tab needs to report OPENING SIZES, not DF sizes. -- DONE
DRW BOX SIZING RULES:
	If drw front sizes deviate from the seed cabinet size, flag to change opening/front sizes. -- DONE

Defaults page: Change default drw front heights to also include equalize bottom and equalize all buttons. -- DONE

Openings Exception Tab needs to report ALL opening sizes, not just the ones that deviate from default. -- DONE






BUGS:

Adjustable shelf not accounting for back thickness in 3D view. Always spaced for 3/4" back -- DONE-ish.

Shelf depth should be all Half or Full. In some places, it is being treated as a number and set to 0. -- DONE


Load the test job. Click on 1st cabinet. Then click 2nd cabinet. The preview is incorrect. Clicking on the 3rd cabinet and then 2nd cabinet shows correctly. WTF
	The problem is going from a Drawer cabinet to a Std 1 Drw cabinet. OpeningHeight1 is not being populated properly.
	Looks like the problem stems from MapModelToViewModel not changing the comboboxes etc.
	Removed if (_isMapping) return; from OnStyleChanged - that fixed the problem, but has it introduced other problems? Let's find out. NOPE --
	The problem is LoadDefaults being called when Type changes. Works fine for choosing a type from the dropdown, but not good if selecting a cabinet in the list. It resets reveals etc.
	What is overriding opening1height when clicking on cabinet list? 
	ResizeOpeningHeights If Style = Style2 is running even when Style = Style1. WTF?
	Style is being set as Style2 when it should be Style1 - demonstrate by putting break in resize opening heights and resize drawer front heights. Is it bounce?
	FIXED! Added if (_isMapping) return; to ResizeOpeningHeights and ResizeDrawerFrontHeights. -- DONE

Drw Count not being set when clicking on cabinet in list. More mapping problems? Yes. OnStyleChanged not running because IsMapping is true. Even calling it explicitly after IsMapping is set to false, somehow IsMapping is true when it reaches it.
	Added OnStyleChanged(oldStyle, model.Style); to the end of the mapping method after capturing the old style at the beginning. Seems like one of those whack-a-mole fixes... let's see what other problems creep up. Too many more and I will
	ditch the whole mapping method and just explicitly set each property to avoid these hard-to-trace headaches.
	Had to remove LoadDefaults from OnStyleChanged again to avoid resetting reveals etc. when clicking on cabinet list. Probably better this way anyway.
	Added LoadDefaults to the Style combobox Closed event handler to set proper defaults when changing styles from the dropdown. -- DONE

When changing from Drawer to Std 1 drw cabinet, opening1 height is populated with the default drwfront1 height. Fixed by adding LoadDefaults to ComboboxClosed event handler. -- DONE
	NOTE: Should apply this to combobox types for upper cabinets too. -- DONE

Base cabinet back and deck are lapped wrong. Deck should be 3/4" less than cab depth and back should lap over deck

Total Cabinets on printed cutlist seems to only be counting line items, not total cabinets including quantities -- DONE


1/4" backs are not showing the proper material texture. WTF? Told to use same texture as PFP in material loading method. -- DONE

Drawer fronts not obeying Defaults setting for Include/Exclude Doors/Drw Fronts -- DONE

Rollout selection not updating properly when clicking around in the list. Will continue to show 1 rollout, and then checking Inc Rollouts will not do anything. -- NEED MOAR INFO TO REPRODUCE

Rollouts need a 0 selection in the dropdown. -- DONE

Doors and Drw boxes not showing in list with 1 cabinet in job. It seems the last cabinet in the list is not having its doors/drw boxes added to the list. -- DONE

Doors & drw front Custom material name not showing in JOb Material list
	Have added helper method ResolveDoorSpeciesForTotals, next is modifying all CreatePanel calls in door creation methods. SEE AI CHAT LOG FOR DETAILS. -- DONE

Changing Drw Front height with Equalize checked does not re-equalize remaining drw fronts. -- DONE

Click equalize all drw fronts, then uncheck. Click load defaults, and default drw front heights don't work. Click it again and it does work. -- DONE

"Custom material, no price" message is not getting cleared when changing material from Custom to standard species. Tried reproducing and couldn't. More testing necessary.





	

TESTING NOTES:

Added Debug.writeline statements to Cab3Dviewmodel & PlaceOrderViewModel to log panel creation for material yield checking. Looks dead on accurate so far. Even accounts for toekick notches etc. Great!
	Next will be to check edgebanding similarly. It was already there and commented out lol. So far looks to be perfect as well.
