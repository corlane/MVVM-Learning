User side:

Finish angle corner cabinet models -- DONE except angle front base toekick board needs to be worked out - I don't think we have a way to do this yet, since we don't normally offer these. 
Finish validation (don't foget to disable add, place order buttons etc. on invalid form) -- DONE. Most validation seems To work as intended. Check more via beta-testing.
	Run Validation on tab change too -- shit doesn't work. The only thing that works is the validation textblocks. So be it. -- DONE. Most validation seems To work as intended. Check more via beta-testing.
Fix "Connected" indicator. It doesn't seem to update properly. Use whatever method was used in CorlaneCabinetOrderFormV2. -- Looks like it is working on bedroom computer. Leave as is and check later.

Move UI elements to be more consistent across tabs
Add separate selection for shelf count for uppers and lowers in Defaults

If cabinet depth is too shallow for drw, display warning - remove drws and hide drw group box - or, adjust depth range validation based on wheter cab has drws
Add nailer on cabs with 1/4" back

OPTIONAL: Add thumbnail images in ListCabinetView -- Talked to AI about it. Looks less complex than I thought. Can be done later.

BUGS:

Adjustable shelf not accounting for back thickness in 3D view. Always spaced for 3/4" back

Shelf depth should be all Half or Full. In some places, it is being treated as a number and set to 0.


Load the test job. Click on 1st cabinet. Then click 2nd cabinet. The preview is incorrect. Clicking on the 3rd cabinet and then 2nd cabinet shows correctly. WTF
	The problem is going from a Drawer cabinet to a Std 1 Drw cabinet. OpeningHeight1 is not being populated properly.
	Looks like the problem stems from MapModelToViewModel not changing the comboboxes etc.
	Removed if (_isMapping) return; from OnStyleChanged - that fixed the problem, but has it introduced other problems? Let's find out. NOPE --
	The problem is LoadDefaults being called when Type changes. Works fine for choosing a type from the dropdown, but not good if selecting a cabinet in the list. It resets reveals etc.
	What is overriding opening1height when clicking on cabinet list? 
	ResizeOpeningHeights If Style = Style2 is running even when Style = Style1. WTF?
	Style is being set as Style2 when it should be Style1 - demonstrate by putting break in resize opening heights and resize drawer front heights. Is it bounce?
	FIXED! Added if (_isMapping) return; to ResizeOpeningHeights and ResizeDrawerFrontHeights. -- DONE

Drw Count not being set when clicking on cabinet in list. More mapping problems? Yes. OnStyleChanged not running because IsMapping is true. Even calling it explicitly after IsMapping is set to false, somehow IsMapping is true when it reaches it.
	Added OnStyleChanged(oldStyle, model.Style); to the end of the mapping method after capturing the old style at the beginning. Seems like one of those whack-a-mole fixes... let's see what other problems creep up. Too many more and I will
	ditch the whole mapping method and just explicitly set each property to avoid these hard-to-trace headaches.
	Had to remove LoadDefaults from OnStyleChanged again to avoid resetting reveals etc. when clicking on cabinet list. Probably better this way anyway.
	Added LoadDefaults to the Style combobox Closed event handler to set proper defaults when changing styles from the dropdown. -- DONE

When changing from Drawer to Std 1 drw cabinet, opening1 height is populated with the default drwfront1 height. Fixed by adding LoadDefaults to ComboboxClosed event handler. -- DONE
	NOTE: Should apply this to combobox types for upper cabinets too. -- DONE

Base cabinet back and deck are lapped wrong. Deck should be 3/4" less than cab depth and back should lap over deck.
