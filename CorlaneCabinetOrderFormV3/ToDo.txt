Finish validation (don't foget to disable add, place order buttons etc. on invalid form)
	Run Validation on tab change too -- shit doesn't work. The only thing that works is the validation textblocks. So be it. -- DONE. Most validation seems To work as intended. Check more via beta-testing.

Panel thickness dropdown needs to change based on dimension format. As is, it won't populate properly. -- DONE
Update is not working anymore? Only main dimensions seem to be updating. Need to check. Try starting fresh and saving a new job file. Seems to be working... test more. 
	Worse: It seems sporadic, and clicking on the cabinet in the list doesn't seem to be reliably updating either.
	MapModelToViewModel seems to be working properly. But it is not updating all form fields. Haven't found a pattern yet. -- DONE
