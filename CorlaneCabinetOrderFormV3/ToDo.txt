Finish validation (don't foget to disable add, place order buttons etc. on invalid form) -- DONE. Most validation seems To work as intended. Check more via beta-testing.
	Run Validation on tab change too -- shit doesn't work. The only thing that works is the validation textblocks. So be it. -- DONE. Most validation seems To work as intended. Check more via beta-testing.

BUGS:

Load the test job. Click on 1st cabinet. Then click 2nd cabinet. The preview is incorrect. Clicking on the 3rd cabinet and then 2nd cabinet shows correctly. WTF
	The problem is going from a Drawer cabinet to a Std 1 Drw cabinet. OpeningHeight1 is not being populated properly.
	Looks like the problem stems from MapModelToViewModel not changing the comboboxes etc.
	Removed if (_isMapping) return; from OnStyleChanged - that fixed the problem, but has it introduced other problems? Let's find out. NOPE --
	The problem is LoadDefaults being called when Type changes. Works fine for choosing a type from the dropdown, but not good if selecting a cabinet in the list. It resets reveals etc.
	What is overriding opening1height when clicking on cabinet list? 
	ResizeOpeningHeights If Style = Style2 is running even when Style = Style1. WTF?
	Style is being set as Style2 when it should be Style1 - demonstrate by putting break in resize opening heights and resize drawer front heights. Is it bounce?
	FIXED! Added if (_isMapping) return; to ResizeOpeningHeights and ResizeDrawerFrontHeights. -- DONE

	Drw Count not being set when clicking on cabinet in list. More mapping problems?
